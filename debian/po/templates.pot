"The \"recover\" program in the package nethack-common is traditionally "
"installed with the \"setgid\" bit set, so that all users can use it to "
"recover their own save files after a crash (with \"games\" group "
"privileges). This is a potential source of security problems."

"This package includes a script that runs during system boot, invoking "
"recover on any broken save files it finds. This makes it less likely that "
"users will need to run it themselves, so the default is to install recover "
"without the special permission bits required for that."
