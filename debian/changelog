nethack (3.4.3-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Thanks for the NMUs, guys. There are so many bugs fixed as a result
    of NMU I won't mention them here, but thanks to Christian Perrier for
    managing everything. Certain things were fixed in 3.4.3-10.7 and have also
    been marked as fixed prior to this upload.
  * Apply translation updates:
    - Vietnamese, thanks Clytie Siddall; closes: #548012
    - Czech, thanks Jan Outrata; closes: #546453
  * Update the nethack-lisp patch to the latest version. closes: #517437
    (The new version is dated 2005-02-27.)
  * Fix yet another incorrect path in the manpage. Thanks Iain. closes: #504925
  * Disable nethack-common.init from 'stopping' when entering shutdown
    runlevels. closes: #547471
  * Change the default for making 'recover' setgid games to true. Thanks Iain.
    closes: #504923, #405465
  * Apply patch to give nethack-x11 and nethack-qt .desktop files. Thanks Iain.
    closes: #504924
  * Install dat/hh at /usr/lib/games/nethack/hh. I know this is a minor FHS
    sin, but it is better than not having it at all right now. (Technically,
    nhdat is a text file too!) closes: #425073
  * Only install recover with gid games (since it may become setuid.) The
    rest are installed with the root gid.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.3.0.
  * Clear out some outdated Lintian overrides.
  * Make /var/games/nethack hierarchy setgid games (instead of merely owned
    and writable by gid games.)

    - Remove x11/Makefile.src, missed last time.
    - Remove old warnings and caveats in README.Debian that are obsoleted
      with 18_overridewin.dpatch. (i.e., stick windowtype:tty into your
      $NETHACKOPTIONS if you intend to set it)
    - Applied a really great debian/rules simplification from
      Aaron Lehmann <aaronl@vitelus.com>
    - 13_simple_mail.dpatch: allow our nethack patches to function
      with dgamelaunch (not in the Debian archive -- yet). Does not
      affect gameplay.
    - Delete nh10.pcf.*, somehow during one build nh10.pcf.gz snuck in.

    - Clean up the build system by removing redundant Makefile.src's.
      + 05_build_cflags.dpatch replaced by 05_makefile_logic.dpatch;

        announcements and inaccessible stairs (closes: #216386)

      messages useful. (Closes: #72582)
    - Set 'ignintr' in the GNOME default nethackrc to work around GNOME
      library bug #216454. Will not close until the bug is resolved in a
      non-hackish way.
    - As per discussion on debian-devel, turn off number_pad by default
      so as not to deviate from upstream.
    - 16_pixmapdir.dpatch: move all pixmaps into /usr/share/pixmaps/nethack/
      and make all graphical nethacks work with this
    - Keep logfile, record, and perm when backing up old save games,
      because they are backwards-compatible with older versions.
      (Closes: #141843)
    - Remove the redundant 'Drop Many' entry from the GNOME Action menu.
      (Closes: #154750)

    - Add French Debconf template translation by Nicolas Bertolissio
      <nico.bertol@free.fr>. (Closes: #218729)
    - Document QT_FONTSIZE, QT_TILEWIDTH, QT_TILEHEIGHT in Qt nethackrc
      (Closes: #141245)
    - Remove the old /etc/init.d/nethack and its symlinks with a manual
      call to update-rc.d on postinst, due to a sneaky name change that
      crept in during 3.4.2 package work. (Closes: #223496)
    - Fix a few warnings in patches.
    - Make sure nethack-common and all the FE packages always have the
      same version using ${Source-Version} dependencies both ways.

      which closes: #184855

    - Update 12_lisp_windowing.dpatch to upstream nethack_el-0.9.2.tar.gz.
    - Add Joshua Kwan to uploaders list for co-maintainership.
  * Joshua Kwan <joshk@triplehelix.org>:
    - Fix FTBFS caused by 'Invisible' being a youprop.h #define
      and used in a QListViewIterator enumerated type. (Closes: #213874)
    - Fix char signedness issue in gnbind.c (Closes: #170531)
    - Build nethack dummy package in binary-indep target. (Closes: #186619)
    - Steal t32-1024.xpm from jnethack - it's missing from NetHack upstream.
      This allows nethack-gnome to use the larger tileset. (Closes: #140398)
    - Now using dh_installinit; use defaults, so we don't go to
      /etc/rcS.d and start before NIS. (Closes: #164132)
    - No clue how this is meant to help, but it doesn't break anything,
      so let's wrap all our menu stuff in sh -c '' and see what happens.
      (Closes: #168385, #168386, #152232)
    - Allow the administrator to decide whether recover should be setgid
      games. (Closes: #148983)
    - Add a menu item to GNOME menu for readying/quivering. (Closes: #154627)
    - Also fix many qt_win.{cpp,h} warnings.
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.6.1.0:
      o Use our own CFLAGS, this allows us to use DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=noopt
      o Use /var/mail instead of /var/spool/mail (although both worked as
        the two are still symlinked to each other)
      o Question about old savegame backup becomes a debconf question,
        and moved meat of the logic into postinst
    - Use debian/compat instead of DH_COMPAT, bump it to V4.
    - Use 'ln -sf' and 'gzip -f' so that multiple calls of binary-arch
      work without cleaning.
    - Fixed upstream URL to one that works
    - Fix clean target so that pristine config.h is restored upon clean
    - Removed redundant call to update-rc.d.
    - Compress the nethack-common changelog.Debian.
    - Migrate source modifications to dpatch patches and build-depend on
      dpatch.
    - Consolidate massive amounts of nearly duplicate config.hs into one
      common configuration patch for include/config.h and add additional
      -Ds to CFLAGS for each build.
    - Add some enhancement patches (Save/bones are NOT affected):
        + 90_enh_hpmon.dpatch: HP monitor which visually alerts you when
          HP goes below 2/3, 1/3, and 1/10 of total.
        + 91_enh_menucolors.dpatch: Enables you to specify regular
          expressions to highlight in your inventory (for example,
          cursed/uncursed/blessed items.)

  * Fix build-dependencies so that package is buildable on unstable.
    (Closes: #184173)
  * Build against multi-threaded Qt3. (Closes: #180215)
  * Include qmemarray.h instead of obsolete qarray.h so that a dependency
    on libqt3-compat-headers is not needed.

nethack (3.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. (Closes: #182742)
  * Upstream included patch to build Nethack on ia64. (Closes: #142079)
  * Boulder -> Landmine segfault fixed upstream. (Closes: #144779)
  * Change Build-Depends to depend on libxaw7-dev | libxaw-dev.
    (Closes: #169995)
  * Top ten list buffer overflow fixed upstream. (Closes: #181854)
  * Mention .nethackrc.gnome, .nethackrc.x11, and .nethackrc.qt files
    (custom to Debian) in nethack manpage. (Closes: #153738)
  * Okay, okay, I made a nethack-console package that has no
    dependancies on any X11 libs or other big packages. 
    (Closes: #140303, #142018)
  * Move dependancy on xbase-clients to nethack-x11.  It's the only
    one that needs font making.
  * Note: We define __USE_GNU in sys/unixres.c; looks like the
    constant RTLD_NEXT is only defined if __USE_GNU is defined.
  * Use Guidebook.txt for docs.  For some reason, plain 'Guidebook'
    is full of garbage now after 'make Guidebook'.
    (Closes: #173127, #177252)

nethack (3.4.0-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Install recover and recover-helper mode 644, not 664. (Closes: #167542)

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Sun,  3 Nov 2002 22:45:27 -0800

nethack (3.4.0-3.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * NMU by the security team.
  * Import security fixes from the slashem package (Closes: #147166).

 -- Daniel Jacobowitz <dan@debian.org>  Sat,  6 Jul 2002 17:01:05 -0400

nethack (3.4.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change DEFAULT_WINDOW_SYS to "tty" unconditionally for all
    GUI frontends.  This fixes the case where a user sets
    NETHACKOPTIONS to customize just the dog/cat name or what have you,
    but doesn't set a windowtype:tty flag.  Then, the /usr/bin/nethack
    script will not touch NETHACKOPTIONS, and it will give a strange
    error when it starts up the Qt/Gnome version if X is unavailable.
    (Closes: #142055)
  * Patch unixconf.h to use /usr/bin/mail instead of /bin/mail.
    (Closes: #142000)
  * Fix nethackrc.qt -> .nethackrc.qt typo in README.Debian.
    (Closes: #141244)
  * Not defining SCORE_ON_BOTL for the time being -- it introduces
    a save-game file incompatibility, so I will do that for the next
    upstream release.

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Wed, 10 Apr 2002 12:31:21 +0900

nethack (3.4.0-2) unstable; urgency=MEDIUM

  * Fix recover to use VAR_PLAYGROUND, not HACKDIR. (Closes: #140701)
  * Fix menu entries.  Now nethack-common has the /usr/games/nethack
    entry (assumed to be text; if the user overrides it, they can
    override the menu entry too), nethack-x11 has /usr/games/xnethack,
    etc. etc. (Closes: #140704)
  * Fix a security bug in recover; other users could "recover"
    save games belonging to users besides themselves.  However,
    they could not load the generated save file unless they could
    also change their UID, as the save file name is always ###playername,
    where ### is the UID allowed to open saved game.
  * Now, recover will only "recover" crash files belonging to the
    same user (or any user, if run by root).  Also, it chowns the
    resultant save file to the original owner of the crash files.
    (Closes: #104247)
  * Add hints "Roguelike,Maze,Dungeon" to menu entries Just For Fun.

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Tue,  2 Apr 2002 23:10:06 +0900

nethack (3.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Split into nethack-common, nethack-x11, nethack-gnome, nethack-qt
    packages. (See README.Debian for details.) 
    (Closes: #88129, #43764, #78046, #53356, #58528)
  * nethack package is now a dummy package that depends on nethack-common
    and nethack-x11 for backwards compatibility.
  * /usr/games/nethack now managed by update-alternatives; can be
    set to either tty or graphical version.
  * Save files changed format again; prompt to back up and wipe
    /var/games/nethack and/or /var/lib/games/nethack on upgrade.
  * Use dh_installman instead of dh_installmanpages.
  * Use dh_installxfonts to register X fonts, etc.
  * Install dlb utility in /usr/lib/games/nethack. (Closes: #129741)
  * Make sure NetHack.tile_file is not commented out in app-defaults
    file. (Closes: #119673)
  * config files moved to /etc/nethack/nethackrc.* for various
    windowing types.  Config files in ~/.nethackrc.* now supported
    per-windowing type.  (HACKOPTIONS still overrides them, though.)
  * Fixed numpad issue many moons ago in xterm: (Closes: #52744)
  * Unable to reproduce old ?a ?b bug in xnethack. (Closes: #86959)
  * (Oops, typo when fixed manpage in last version.) (Closes: #111097)
  * desparate -> desperate in package description (Closes: #125180)
  * Using --prefix for tempfile now. (Closes: #54586)
  * Shipping with NetHack*autofocus: False in X11 application-defaults
    file to work around odd Xaw bugs that pop up now and again; the
    patch supplied in #94298 no longer applies to 3.4.0, but the
    crashes still show up with NetHack*autofocus: True once in
    a while.

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Sat, 23 Mar 2002 21:57:18 +0900

nethack (3.3.1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sorry for being out of touch for a while. I'm back in business
    now that I'm settled down in Tokyo, and have my own desktop computer
    again.
  * Work-around for Xt-related segfaults. May be fixed upstream in
    next release. (Closes: #94298)
  * Use upstream NetHack application-defaults file, and merge in changes
    from upstream nethack.rc for X11 with our customized Debian one.
    (Closes: #95533)
  * Check for existence of old /var/lib/games/nethack dir before
    warning about its possible existence (covers when a user installs
    a pre 3.3.1-5 nethack, purges it, then installs a newer one).
    (Closes: #95536)
  * Fix manpage to refer to /usr/bin/mail and
    /usr/lib/games/nethack. (Closes: #111096)

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Sat, 22 Sep 2001 20:13:10 +0900

nethack (3.3.1-6) unstable; urgency=MEDIUM

  * Whoops.  Forgot to copy over the old save/high score files
    from /var/lib/games/nethack -> /var/games/nethack.
    Do so carefully, then remove the old directory. (Closes: #92501)
  * postrm/preinst still had old dir in there. Oops. 
    So did /etc/init.d/nethack..  I'm very embarassed. Fixed.
  * The preinst does still look in /var/lib/games/nethack for
    pre-3.3.1 versions to archive them.

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Thu, 12 Apr 2001 20:01:04 -0700

nethack (3.3.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix FHS bug (/var/lib/games -> /var/games). (Closes: #92501)
  * Just a note, I'm not working on building gnomehack as of yet,
    because with GTK+ 1.2.9 and later, it's quite useless, since
    nethack has to run set-GID and GTK+ >= 1.2.9 forbids this 
    (with good reason.)
  * A lot of bugs were reassigned from gnomehack to nethack that
    are not nethack bugs.
    - Nethack is in .orig.tar.gz+.diff.gz format. (Closes: #62976)
    - No alsa deps for nethack. (Closes: #56738)
    - The stairs bug mentioned is unreproducable in stock Nethack.
      (Closes: #72202)
    - Menu entry for creating new game bug?  Seems gnome-specific.
      (Closes: #79771)
    - Options dialog bug is gnomehack-specific. (Closes: #64944)
    - Gnomehack used a different recovery script that was broken.
      Not applicable to nethack. (Closes: #69080, #71193)

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Wed, 11 Apr 2001 18:45:00 -0700

nethack (3.3.1-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add Build-Deps on libxaw-dev and bsdmainutils. (Closes: #89565)
    Thanks to neuro and BenC for pointing these out.

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Tue, 13 Mar 2001 20:05:13 -0800

nethack (3.3.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Buh.  Stupid typo in /etc/init.d/nethack; doesn't actually run.
    Fixed.  Also implemented stop|reload|restart|force-reload (which
    do nothing, as this is a rcS.d-only script) for policy reasons.
  * Lintian fix: make symlink for license file relative.
  * Lintian fix: don't use menu icon "none".

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Mon, 12 Mar 2001 23:53:45 -0800

nethack (3.3.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug hunting release: add Build-Depends (Closes: #84643)
  * Change init.d/nethack to not exit on failure, and be ash-compliant
    (Closes: #75972)
  * Move app-defaults to new /etc/X11 location and make it a
    conffile. (Closes: #86281)
  * Patch from Ian Jackson to make recover look in the right place.
    (Closes: #72584)
  * Fixed LOGDIR typo long ago. (Closes: #65486)
  * Remove call to dh_suidregister and add Conflicts: suidmanager (<< 0.50)
  * Change calls to /usr/X11R6/bin/ utilities to /usr/bin/X11/.
  * Add Depends: on xutils, as we call mkfontdir in postinst/postrm.

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Mon, 12 Mar 2001 21:14:57 -0800

nethack (3.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. (Huzzah!)
  * Wow. I don't have to build with special patches any more; just
    about *everything* was accepted upstream. Go DevTeam! You guys
    rule. :) (One thing I noticed wasn't patched upstream was
    disabling IBMgraphics on the Rogue level. If people still notice
    problems, let me know; the historic problems with IBMgraphics
    on the rogue level may have been fixed.

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Fri, 11 Aug 2000 16:52:27 -0700

nethack (3.3.0-9) unstable; urgency=low

nethack (3.3.0-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch to fix bones-file handling in /var/lib/games/nethack.
    (The bones-file functions were changed from 3.2.2 and so
    broke my older patch.) Closes: #54961

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Wed, 12 Jan 2000 21:50:01 -0800

nethack (3.3.0-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change /usr/games/nethack script to remove stupid 'max number of
    Nethack players at once' hack.
  * Change /etc/init.d/nethack to work on *any* lock files in
    /var/lib/games/nethack (use *.0 instead of *lock.0)
  * Patch to fix nasty bugs introduced by separating lock/savefiles
    into /var/lib/games/nethack. (Forgot some /s to a few sprintfs,
    ouch!)
  * Patch to fix recover to work with separate /var/lib/games/nethack
    once again. Closes: #52995
  * Change default cat/dog/fruit names when using xnethack to be
    more.. Debian-y. :)

  * Make root the user able to enter wizard (debug) mode with 'nethack -D'
    instead of user 'wizard', the old default. Closes: #53901
  * Add link from /usr/lib/games/nethack/license -> 
    /usr/share/doc/nethack/copyright so ?i works in game. Closes: #53979
  * Make sure we pass arguments to nethack when run from xnethack
    script. Fixes: #54104

  * Add color patch to fix swap of red and blue colors.
  * Port Linux console IBMgraphics patch from 3.2.2.
  * Remove all use of --suffix argument to tempfile, to make
    building slink packages easier. Closes: #52968

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Fri, 17 Dec 1999 15:26:05 -0800

nethack (3.3.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

nethack (3.3.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Note split of spoilers in README.Debian. Closes: #52628
  * Improve logic in preinst for various combinations of 'install' and
    'upgrade' arguments.
  * Test for existence of /var/lib/games/nethack before trying to archive
    it in preinst. Closes: #52666
  * (Yes, 3.3.0 fixes the Y2K bugs in Nethack! Sorry for not mentioning
     this below.)

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Mon, 13 Dec 1999 22:15:10 -0800

nethack (3.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Finally! A new upstream version! Fixes: #52565
  * No more bashisms in postinst. Fixes: #36006
  * Use /etc/init.d/nethack and a link /etc/rcS.d/nethack instead
    of /etc/rc.boot/nethack. Fixes: #32441
  * Spoilers split off into separate nethack-spoilers package. (Note:
    spoilers may be out of date now for 3.3.0!)
  * NOTE NOTE NOTE: Save files from 3.2.2 are *NOT COMPATIBLE* with
    3.3.0 so the preinst will prompt the user and archive the old
    save directory, or abort.
  * Now depends on debianutils (>= 1.13) because we use 'tempfile'
    program in the preinst to get a safe filename for archiving
    into for the above NOTE NOTE NOTE. This sucks, though, because
    slink's debianutils is 1.10, but it doesn't support the
    --suffix we need to make a tempfile with .tar.gz as the extension.

  * Use Hartmut Koptein's patch for glibc 2.1 prototypes checking.
    (Fixes: #32012)

nethack (3.2.2-14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add test in preinst to make sure we don't check $2 on anything
    but an upgrade, as dpkg can call the preinst with no $2 if
    we're doing a fresh install, and that'll make my test to see
    what version we're upgrading from crash. (Fixes: #27101)

nethack (3.2.2-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made postinst really anal on checks for upgrades from old versions,
    to make all permissions correct. (Fixes: #25881, #19588)
  * Converted debian/rules to debhelper. (Fixes: #14492)
  * /var/lib/games/nethack/{record,logfile,perm} are no longer conffiles,
    and the management of them has moved to the postinst/postrm scripts.
  * Enabled tiles by default when running with X enhancements.
  * Created xnethack script to run the X-based nethack.
  * Disabled the mail daemon mail-check in X-based nethack, as it
    could cause nethack to freeze if run from the menu entry (as
    opposed to from within an xterm).

    prevent cheating.
  * Really fixed bug #10149 -- both logfile and record are now
